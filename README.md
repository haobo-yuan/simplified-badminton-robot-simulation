This project utilizes the Fetch robot model, sourced from the [Fetch robot repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/fetch_ros/tree/melodic-devel/fetch_description). The author does not claim copyright over any model files from this repository.

## Project Description
This Python-based project simulates a badminton-playing robot. The simulation is created using the PyBullet physics engine. Users can control the robot's movement along a straight line and manually control its arm to hit a shuttlecock. The simulation provides an interactive environment to explore the dynamics of robot movement and object manipulation in a virtual badminton game.

## Installation and Requirements
To run this simulation, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- PyBullet: Install using `pip install pybullet`

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Python script: `python pybullet_badminton.py`
4. Control the robot using the "a" and "d" keys to move left and right, respectively.
5. Use the sliders in the GUI to control the robot's arm movement.

## Contact Information
This is a simplified and unfinished project that will be used for training a badminton robot player through robot learning techniques.
